from_dataset
    Creates a CDIModel from an appropriate CDataset
simulate_to_dataset
    Creates a CDataset from the simulation defined in the model

    Saves out a dictionary with the recovered parameters


Simulation
----------
interaction
    Simulates exit waves from experimental parameters

        subset : list(int) or int

        regularization_factor : float or list(float)
            Optional, if the model has a regularizer defined, the set of 
            parameters to pass the regularizer method.
        thread : bool
            Default True, whether to run the computation in a separate thread 
            to allow interaction with plots during computation.
        calculation_width : int

        Optionally, a dataset can be passed, which will allow plotting of any

        Note that this function is not very intelligent - so, for example,

        plotting function allows one to scroll between different modes, it
        will simply save whichever mode happens to be showing at the moment.
        Therefore, this should not be treated as a good way of saving out
        the full state of the reconstruction.

        By default, the files will be named by the figure titles as defined
        in the plot_list. Files can be saved with any extension suported by
        matplotlib.pyplot.savefig.
